My first repository

Hello my fellow friends,

  Its Justin here. Welcome to my first repository. I love playing the violin and eating pizza. My favorite subject in school is Math and my favoite sport is football. I go to Langsotn Hughes Middle School which is an awesome school. My family consists of 2 loving parents and 2 friendly sibiling. I have a sister and a brother. My whole family is very nice. I am so thankful that I am in this family. I love reading fiction books that are adventurousand make you read more of it. I also be in the kitchen and cook. I can cook any type of food that has instructions of how to make it. I have made cupcakes, brownies, cakes and many more. I am now learning of how to make much more delicious stuff like pasta, guacamole and many others. I also love to go out with my family on a walk or ride my bike. During the summer times we sometimes go with our bikes to the near by W&OD trail. THe farthest I have ever went was till Reston. My goal by next year is to go all the way to DC! You think that my goal is never going to get accomplished but with perseverance I think I will accomplish this goal. 

See you next time, Bye!
Justin
